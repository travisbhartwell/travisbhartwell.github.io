    <p>I went to lunch today at an Indian restaurant with my coworkers. When we went to pay, I ran into a very common problem for me.</p>

<p>I’m only 4’6″ (roughly 137 cm for my non-Imperial friends) tall.</p>

<p>The counter at the cash register was pretty much as tall as me. I could barely see over it. I certainly couldn’t reach to use it to sign my reciept when I paid. Like I said, a common problem for me. But wasn’t common was just a small thing — and I don’t even think I can fully describe how significant it was or what made it significant to me — that the owner of the restaurant did.</p>

<p>When I took my turn to step up to the counter to pay, she immediately apologized to me that I couldn’t reach or see things. After I handed her my card, she got one of those little folders for credit card receipts, stepped to the side of the counter, and handed it to me with my card and my receipt and a pen so I could sign the receipt. My coworkers had just signed their receipts on the top of the counter. But she made this kind little gesture to make it so I could sign things.</p>

<p>I don’t why it had such significance for me. She didn’t make a big deal out of things. But at the same time, she took a moment to help me out and did it in a kind manner. It’s these little things that make me comfortable and not fret about being different.</p>

<p>As usual, any discussion of transplantation hits close to home to me. I’ve felt to share a few reactions to parts of Dr. Lim’s talk, almost as therapy for myself, to understand the process I myself have been through and the future I have to look forward to as well. A few remarks:</p>

<p>Dr. Lim mentioned a statistic I’ve heard many other places.  More than a dozen people die each day in the United States alone while waiting for a suitable donor organ. This brings up many feelings I have faced before. When I was on dialysis, I admit I felt guilty. I was only on dialysis for 3 months while I was waiting for everything to come together for my transplant. Yet, most of my fellow patients at the dialysis center would never get that opportunity due to age or other factors. Naturally, the questions of, “Why am I so lucky to have this opportunity? And, even, why me?” came up. And they came up again, with tears, as I thought about the wonderful gift I was given as I listened to Dr. Lim.</p>

<p>She goes on to talk about a difficult assignment she had and the situation in Singapore, her native country. After performing the first successful cadavaric liver transplant, she was assigned to harvest organs for transplantation from executed prisoners. Many individuals, due to their indigent circumstances, are coerced into donating organs in order to receive money to support themselves or their families. Such a risk and a gift should not be one of coercion — I am so glad I know that my donor kidney was freely given. But the discussion made me think of the moral implications of such a thing.</p>

<p>Then she goes on to discuss her current research — transplanting stem cells instead of entire organs. In fact, her associates are exploring deriving stem cells from adipose or fat cells, which I believe, as she does, removes many of the moral and ethical questions arising from using embryonic stem cells. Imagine it! A doctor could take my own fat cells and use them to generate a new kidney, a new retina, or whatever cells I need. Amazing!</p>

<p>Stem cells can be used to cure and treat diseases I deal with and some that are very dear to me deal with. When I started watching this video, I had no idea it would hit even closer to home, with the inevitability of blindness I face with my retinitis pigmentosa. I also have those dear to me that deal with autoimmune diseases. Dr. Lim herself has retinal issues and has a new-found desire and empathy towards her patients with such afflictions. I am excited for the potential this brings.</p>

<p>These talks always give me hope. They give me pause to think about how such medical technologies and pioneering have truly affected my life. If I was born even 20 years earlier, there are many things in my life that would have prevented me from living as long as I have, in some cases even past infancy. Of course, then, I still think. Why me? Why am I so lucky? I thank Dr. Lim and the many pioneers like her, <a href="http://iam.travishartwell.net/2011/03/11/world-kidney-day-and-a-special-thanks/" title="World Kidney Day and a special thanks">I thank my kidney donor and the rest of those that have helped me</a> – I thank all of those that have made it possible for me to be this lucky.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The other day, right after I had my weekly blood work done I had a meeting with a trusted advisor.  I don’t take my morning doses of my medication until after I do blood work, and I hadn’t had a chance to gather my pills into a daily pill box, so I just had a bag with all of the original prescription bottles with me.  My advisor knew of my medcine regime, but it was kind of an eye opener to her seeing all of the bottles I had to go through.</p>

<p>This got me thinking.  What has become (or been, depending on what it is) the norm for me in my life are often things so pervasive in my activities, I think I sometimes forget that many of these things are foreign to most people.  I admit that I’ve struggled lately as it feels like all I have to talk about are some of the medical things in my life.  But I realize I don’t want to go to the opposite side.  People should know and understand, hoping that the more people understand this is “just what I have to do” it won’t be all that unusual.  I’d like to compare this with dental care.  We don’t feel pity or sorrow or amazement when someone does the normal routines of brushing and flossing their teeth every day, going to the dentist for cleaning, or even more elaborate dental work.  It’s a rather normal part of life.  Though fewer people will experience what I experience, just as those things are what we all have to do to keep our teeth healthy, this is what I have to do.</p>

<p>So, I thought I’d write about my current routines.  Most of these things, unless otherwise noted, are related to my chronic kidney disease (specifically reflux nepropathy) and my subsequent kidney transplant I received on June 19, 2009.</p>

<h2 id="medication">Medication</h2>

<p>First, here’s all of the bottles for the different medications I take in a given week:</p>

<p><img src="http://iam.travishartwell.net/images/life-as-a-kidney-transplant-patient-part-1-medication/bottles.jpg" alt="Pill bottles" /></p>

<p>I believe that is currently 17 different oral medications plus my eye drops.  When I am on top of things, once I week I fill my daily pill boxes, which have four compartments each.  I just finished mine for the upcoming week:</p>

<p><img src="http://iam.travishartwell.net/images/life-as-a-kidney-transplant-patient-part-1-medication/boxes.jpg" alt="Pill boxes" /></p>

<p>This makes it quite convenient to carry my medication with me.  My current regimen consists of taking the oral medications at 8 AM, noon, 4 PM, and 8 PM.  I am also getting into the routine of using recently prescribed eye drops three times a day, currently at 8 AM, 3 PM, and 10 PM.</p>

<p>I’d like to run down the different kinds of medication I take.  I may not mention them all by name and especially not dosage, as I’m sure they are highly dependent on the patient and I work closely with my doctor to make sure I’m always getting what I need and at the right dosage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Immunosuppresants</strong> - I am currently on three different immunosuppresants, including a steroid.  Because anything that is not of my own DNA is seen as foreign by my body, the healthy immune system will attack it.  Therefore, in order to keep the transplanted kidney, I am on medication aimed specifically to suppress the immune system.  Unfortunately, these very medications that are allowing me to have the kidney function I need to be alive are also the source of many of the problems I have had post-trsnsplant, due to their side effects and also the things I’ve had because of my supppressed immunity.  As long as I have a transplanted kidney, I will have to be on some level of these medications.  As much as I appreciate the transplant, the wonderful gift my donor gave to me, and the availability of these medications, perhaps you might understand why I am excited for the future possibility of getting a kidney grown or printed from my own cells.  I would no longer have to take these medications, or many of the others required to offset their effects. Also note that, in particular, I cannot miss a single dose of these medications, or I run the risk of damaging my transplanted kidney and going through rejection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blood Pressure Medications</strong> - I currently am on two different blood pressure medications.  The kidneys are part of the regulatory mechanisms for blood pressure.  Sustained high blood pressure can also damage the kidneys.  So I have to be on constant medication to make sure this is at a more manageable level.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vitamin and Mineral Supplements</strong> - The kidneys are responsible for the regulation of vitamins and minerals in the body, so I have to take extra supplements for some things that I am not able to absorb from my diet alone.  This includes Magnesium, Calcium, and Vitamin D.  I also have to take Sodium Bicarbinate to help regulate my body’s pH level.  Since the kidneys are responsible for minerals, and the steroid I’m on has a known side effect of bone density loss, I have actually developed osteoporosis, thus the Calcium and Vitamin D.  I also take a prescription medication to help prevent bone loss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Digestive-related</strong> - Side effects of these other medications I’m on (particularly the steroid) are often hard on the stomach and digestive tract.  I take daily doses of prescription strength Prilosec and also another medication.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Antibiotic and Anti-viral</strong> - Because of my suppressed immunity, I am much more suseptible to infections and viruses.  I take a low-grade anti-biotic 3 times a week as a preventative measure, and I’m on a antiviral medication for the next couple of months to treat a viral infection I contracted a while back.  I am also currently taking another antibiotic as I have another urinary tract infection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong> - I am also on regular medication for depression and anxiety and ADD.  Some of the other medications I’m on are known to have effect on various neurotransmitters, so I have needed the extra help to offset these.  Additionally, I have another medication I’ve been on most of my life for support of some bladder issues that I have.  Lastly, as mentioned above, I have prescription eye drops that I use 3 times daily that I just started using to deal with some recently discovered issues that are unrelated to my kidney disease or transplant.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So that is my current regime for medication.  Maybe you can understand why the people at my local pharmacy know me quite well.  My dosing and list of medications I am on often changes weekly, depending upon the results of my laboratory blood work, so it is often hard to plan ahead and I have to make several trips to my local pharmacy a week to get new medication.</p>

<p>I will write more later about the other aspects of my life that are a result of my kidney disease and transplant, including laboratory work and so forth.</p>

<p>I’m just grateful I live in a time when these things are available to extend my life, frustrations of the side effects notwithstanding.</p>

    <p>Today, March 10th, is <a href="http://www.worldkidneyday.org/">World Kidney Day</a>.  This morning the <a href="http://www.nephcure.org/">Nephcure Foundation</a> shared an important reminder for those of us dealing with kidney disease:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don&#39;t forget that today is World Kidney Day! Who helps you deal with kidney disease?

<p>I want to take this opportunity to thank all of the people who have helped me as I have dealt with my kidney disease. I will try not to miss anyone, but I am sorry if I don’t name everyone by name. I appreciate all of the help, the love, and the prayers. In my struggles I may not always show it like I should, and of that I am sorry. Also, the ordering here is not indicative of how important I think an individual’s help has been. Without further adieau, I am grateful for all of these:</p>

    <p><em>Ann Henson</em> - this wonderful woman is and will forever be my second mother. Just like my own mother gave me life and love 34 years ago, nearly two years ago this wonderful woman gave me life again. When she found out that I had kidney disease and would need a transplant at some point, she was immediately willing and wanted to be the first one in line to see if she could donate. It is because of this sacrifice I am alive today. And, despite some very difficult circcumstances that have happened since, she still cares deeply and does not regret a minute what she did for me. Thank you Ann. Thank you so much.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Torie</em> - You stood by my side with love, concern, and help through some of the most difficult times during this. I would have never made it through the difficulty of going through dialysis and the transplant without you by my side. I can’t imagine what you had to go through, seeing me like that, and also knowing the risk your mother was taking to help me. Thank you for doing your best, especially when circumstances were that I wasn’t the easiest to live with. I will always love you for this. (I have to also mention here the wonderful little puppy girl Callie. She was always so loving. I could just feel her love and concern and see it on her face on those days when I wasn’t doing so well or when I was recuperating from surgery. Her little kisses and snuggles meant the world to me. Daddy will always love you Callie).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>My Parents, Bert and Sharon</em> - You have always loved me and stood by me through the difficult times in my life. It is because of your love and determination I am alive. You have done so much for me these last few years and I will forever be grateful. I wish I could show it better. I am sorry it has been so hard for you to see me struggle through these times of my life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Kevin and the rest of the Henson family</em> - thanks for being so supportive of me, Torie, and Ann through all of this. I am forever indebted to you. I include their extended family, especially including Ann’s neice Tammy, who flew out here to be here during the transplant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>My brother Joe, his wife Angie, and my sister Sharalyn</em> - You are all so awesome and have done so much for me. I love the sacrifices you have made in your lives to help me out. The trips to come see me when I couldn’t go myself. The phone calls, the texts, the loving concern. I will always look up to you all, am grateful for the successes you are finding in your lives and the examples you are for me, and still stand by me even when I’ve struggled. I love you so much.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The rest of my family</em> - I am grateful for my entire family, for the concern they’ve shown and the help they’ve given me. I am especially grateful for my aunt Margie for all the help and visits and things she’s been able to do because she has lived so close.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>My friends, especially Daniel, Paul, and Vee</em> - I have such amazing friends, from all over the world. I got an unexpected card from my friends Andrew and Mary from Australia when I had my transplant. I’ve had countless friends reach out with love and concern, it’s so hard to name them all. I am especially grateful for my closest friends that are (or were) local to me, Daniel and Paul and Vee. They have done so much for me. Daniel has been a life saver and put up with so much. He’s kindly opened his house to me so I have a place to live through this difficult time. He’s taken me to the emergency room and the hospital many times when I could not myself. Paul and Vee did much the same when they were still living in Utah, and continue to be a great support from afar. I don’t know what I would do without these great people in my life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Dr. Hammond, Mark Boyack, Jenna and the rest of the staff at Central Utah Nephrology</em> - I have been blessed with an amazing medical team. Dr. Hammond is my nephrologist (kidney specialist) and he and his staff are constantly looking out for me and going above and beyond just to make sure I am getting better. Thank you for the everything you do to help me be healthy and happy. Whatever payment you receive from me or my insurance company doesn’t even come close to make up for what you’ve done and are doing for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Dr. Van der Werf, Dr. Alonzo, and the rest of the doctors and staff at the <a href="http://intermountainhealthcare.org/hospitals/imed/services/transplantnew/Pages/home.aspx">Intermountain Transplant Center</a> in Murray, Utah –</em> Dr. Van der Werf and Dr. Alozono were the surgeons who performed the transplant, with Dr. Alonzo performing the surgery on Ann, and then assisting Dr. Van der Werf with me. I am forever grateful for your knowledge, skill, and concern. I’m grateful for my transplant coordinator Barb, the financial coordinator Becky who has helped me with Medicare and other insurance issues, and everyone else at the transplant center that have been so helpful through this process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The doctors, nurses, and staff at the Intermountain Medical Center, American Fork Hospital, Utah Valley Medical Center, Madison Memorial Hospital, and the Central Utah Clinic Surgical Center</em> - when I have had to spend time in the hospital either because of surgery or problems, I have always received the best care. The doctors and nurses have shown the upmost concern and skill in caring for me. It has always been comforting to have such wonderful and caring nurses and assistants who want what’s best for me. Thank you all for the amazing people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The phlebotomists and nurses at the various laboratories I’ve visited</em> - I have had frequent labs over the years and I am always thankful for the gentleness, concern, and care shown by those that draw my blood. You may have given me a few bruises, but I’m thankful for the job you do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The nurses and staff at Davita Dialysis in American Fork</em> - I was only on dialysis for the 3 months prior to my transplant, but I got to know these wonderful people during my 9 hours a week there. It was because of your concern, positivity, and hard work that the experience was bearable. Thank you so much for all you did for me and my fellow patients.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The pharmacists and techs at Wal-mart</em> - You have got to know me quite well over the last few years. Thanks for always being so cheerful and willing to help. Thanks for looking after me and bringing up concerns and suggestions about my medication and being willing to answer questions that I’ve had going through all of this. You guys are lifesavers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>My former employer Mozy and coworkers there</em> - You guys were nothing but accomdating and supportive as I wen through this, were completely supportive as I started dialysis and then worked with me as I had to have time off to recover from my transplant. I don’t know how many times I ended up taking a nap and sleeping longer than I should on the Ops department bean bag when I was so exhausted because of dialysis. And yet you were always supportive and kind. Thanks so much.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The HR staff at my last employer Canonical</em> - they have bent over backwards to help me so I can maintain my insurance coverage through COBRA, helping me get my payments in and such, when it was difficult because of hospital stays. Thanks for your patience and concern.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>My ward members and leaders from church</em> - in the 3 wards I’ve been in during this time, I’ve always had fellow ward members and leaders show great concern and do whatever they could to help me. I am so grateful for that.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are countless other friends, family, medical professionals, and others who have constantly gone out of their way to help me. I wish I could name them all and show my gratitude to them all.</p>

<p>On a less personal level, there have been many things that have got me through this time, including favorite music, books, and other entertainment. In particular, we were able to meet the band Creed (my favorite band) a few months after my transplant. I mentioned to them how much their music has got me through some very rough times, including my transplant. We had front row seats, and during the the concert, Scott Stapp, the lead singer, stood in front me me, pointing, and making eye contact during one of the songs, reminding me to remember “What this life’s for.” Thank you so much.</p>

<p>I am forever indebted to all of these wonderful people. I’ll never quite understand the sacrifices done on my behalf. I just hope some day I can even begin to repay you all for the wonderful blessings you have brought into my life.</p>

<p>Happy World Kidney Day. Take care of your kidneys. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, or a family history of those or kidney disease, please see your doctor and get checked. It’s just a simple blood test.</p>
