  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In two previous posts, I wrote about ideas that <a href="http://iam.travishartwell.net/2011/06/26/resonance/">resonate</a> with me and also this state of being that I got into while <a href="http://iam.travishartwell.net/2011/06/17/driving-in-my-car/">driving my new car</a>.  Tonight I watched a TEDx video from Leone Ross, an author.  She really spoke to me, as someone who is striving to find himself in creativity and creation.  But, in particular, is her last point, which I have linked to it here (just a couple minutes for the part I’m referring to):</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/j3MsWj8UigU" frameborder="0"> </iframe>

<p>Flow is something that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi/e/B000AQ1KVM/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a> has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi/dp/0061339202">written about</a> extensively. I think his definition matches very closely with her description in the above video. One of the things I like most about the way she describes the experience of flow is that it comes from simple repitition, something that you have done over and over again. I think this matches up very well with what Malcolm Gladwell talks about in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930">Outliers</a> when he talks about those that are most successful it is because they’ve done something for 10,000 hours. I think it also fits with what Galwey writes about in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inner-Game-Tennis-Classic-Performance/dp/0679778314">The Inner Game of Tennis</a>. He talks about getting to the point in your tennis game where you aren’t thinking about things, but your swing just comes from knowing how a good swing feels, and just doing it.</p>

<p>I could come up with a ton more examples from sports or creative endeavors.  Regardless, this video is just another beautiful reminder of a concept that keeps getting hammered home to me.  Repitition.  Practice.  Consistent practice.  It’s something I’m trying to apply to all important areas of my life.  This resonates with me, and I take it a little bit more as part of me.</p>

    <p>On the first Sunday of every month, in the main meeting of our church, members of the congregation get to take the opportunity to come forward and share their own belief and faith.  It is something that I have not done in a long time, so I felt today to get up and do this.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about some of the things I said and some things a little beyond what I said there.  It really is something that I’m slowly coming to terms with, accepting, and embracing as something that is just part of my story.</p>

<p>In truth — and this isn’t whining, just the facts — I have had a rough few years.  In the last three years, I been through the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>been laid off or otherwise had to part ways with 3 jobs</li>
  <li>thus been unemployed for almost a year and a half in aggregate</li>
  <li>was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney disease</li>
  <li>had to do dialysis for 3 months</li>
  <li>had a kidney transplant</li>
  <li>had another minor surgery</li>
  <li>spent over 3 months in aggregate in the hospital</li>
  <li>discovered the eye problems I was having are worse than I thought</li>
  <li>had to stop driving at night because of my eye sight</li>
  <li>found out I could be blind in a decade</li>
  <li>had my marriage end</li>
  <li>wrecked and totaled my car</li>
  <li>took on a lot of extra debt because of unemployment and necessary medical expenses</li>
</ul>

<p>I share this because lessons are learned often in the hard and difficult times.  During these times I have had to rely on the sacrifice and service of others and that has been something very hard for me to do.  I have often questioned why these great things are done in my behalf.  I often question why I am still alive, why my life has been spared; I’ve certainly stared death in the face in the last few years.</p>

<p>I share all of this as an introspection of where I am today and where I’ve been.  I admit, I would be amazed at anyone else who has had all of these things happen to them.  But I don’t think I’m that special.  Sometimes, when faced with life threatening things, some people rise up and show what amazing people they are.  Lance Armstrong went on to win several Tour de France after having cancer.  Though succumbing to the disease, Randy Pausch was able to inspire and help many people (and still does) after being diagnosed with cancer.  Michael J. Fox has gone on to be a tireless advocate for research and treatment of Parkison’s since his diagnosis.  And Ludwig van Beethoven was able to compose what I consider one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever after going completely deaf.  And the list goes on.</p>

<p>Well, I’m not one of those people.  In fact, I have really struggled.  I was (and am) hurt and scared by my kidney disease.  I became bitter and angry, fighting with people that in a very real way I felt were saying that they didn’t care about whether I lived or died and that if I needed help, I was lazy, taking advantage of people, and not worth anything.  I lashed out and got scared.  Life scared me — even the things I wanted and treasured the most I was so afraid of.</p>

<p>I write this to say that I’m starting to accept it more.  I will never be that totally amazing person that conquers it all.  Yes, I have been through a lot.  But I didn’t sail through it.  There is much that I feel great sorrow and regret for.  I did the best I could given where I had come from and what I was going through.  If I could, there are some things I would definitely change and I wish with my whole being that I could.  But that’s not possible.</p>

<p>This is my reality.  I have to do and be my best.  I am sorry if I get scared.  I’m sorry if I get angry.  I am sorry if I am emotional all the time.  I can only do my best.  I can only do what I can at the capability and habits I currently have, no matter how much I want to be better.  Some days, getting out of bed and going to work is a major accomplishment.  Some days, just taking my medications that I need to keep alive is a major accomplishment.  Other days, I feel like I could conquer the world.</p>

<p>But I have to be okay with where I am.  I know I want to be better.  I certainly wish I could be like Randy Pausch, Lance Armstrong, Micheal J. Fox, or Beethoven.  But I’m not them.  I’m me.  And right now, just the fact that I am alive and still have my friends and family that love me is what I have and what I can do.  If someone has problems with where I am, or the pace at which I am healing and changing, ultimately it has to be their problem.  It can’t be mine.  I can’t take the weight of the world on my shoulders.  I’ve tried, and even with 3 kidneys I just can’t do it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>It was probably over a decade ago that this conversation happened, but the questions and lessons from it keep coming back again and again. I was discussing religion and philosophy with a friend. As he would ask certain things, I would respond by quoting (or paraphrasing) something I had read. I don’t even remember the specifics of the conversation, but what I do remember is his response.</p>

<p>My friend kept insisting that he preferred to think for himself and, by implication, the words and ideas he should use should be his own. He did not want to trust anyone else or rely on their words.</p>

<p>I reflected on this time and again. Now, this isn’t an exploration of faith or what I believe. Suffice it to say, what I do believe is a result of my choice to believe. But why do the expression of these ideas come from words that originated from outside of me?</p>

<p>To properly answer that, I need to draw an analogy to some concepts from basic high school or college physics. (Don’t worry, I don’t remember enough about differential equations to get into the math, so I won’t go there.) The analogy? When someone learns a concept that just fits them, they often say, “This <em>resonates</em> with me.” With a little understanding of what resonance (and the related concept of harmonic oscillation) is, I think we’ll see that this makes more sense as an analogy than we sometimes realize.</p>

<p>Resonance is the process that causes oscillation (either moving back and forth or up and down) in an object. This oscillation happens at a specific frequency, and there is no energy loss or dampening effect from this.</p>

<p><img src="http://iam.travishartwell.net/images/resonance/Simple_harmonic_motion_animation.gif" alt="" title="Simple Harmonic Motion Animations" /></p>

<p>I remember a lab in my college physics class where by some basic calculations we were able to apply the right frequency to a string that would then cause a certain sinusoidal pattern. If our calculations were off, the patterns would not form. These patterns would then only happen at certain frequencies. It was one of the more effective labs for transforming the math behind the physics into application that we could observe.</p>

<p>So how does this relate to the discussion of ideas? Just as certain frequencies applied to this system created harmonic oscillation, certain ideas, words, and phrases introduced into my life just fit. Just as a harmonic oscillator doesn’t lose energy or dampen, these ideas, words, and phrases stick.</p>

<p>A great example from my life is the tools, programming languages, and libraries that I have used over the years.  I found with some, it took a lot of effort to keep and understanding and remembrance of them in my head.  Yet, others just fit and took little effort to maintain a level of competency in, even if I was away from their use for a while.  These concepts, ideas, and languages resonated with me, and I kept them as part of my toolbox.</p>

<p>Further, I find this even more interesting as you look at the nature of sound and then apply how many connect with music on a deep level. There are just some songs that seem to speak to me, as if the artist was inside my head and heart when they wrote it. The acoustic harmony along with the words resonate with me.</p>

<p>As these ideas, words, phrases, and music are introduced to me, they resonate. They fit. In analogy, their natural frequencies match my own. Essentially, then, they have become part of me. Even though they may have originated elsewhere, it’s as if they have come from my own mind, heart, and soul.</p>

<p>So there are certain songs that resonate with me. There are certain stories that resonate. There are certain talks and speeches I’ve heard that resonate. There are ideas that resonate. And they have become part of the library of material that makes up who I am today. These words, phrases, musical notes, ideas are part of what makes me who I am. Sometimes I can’t tell you what attracts me to certain things. Other times, I know exactly.</p>

<p>Just as different harmonic oscillations happen at different frequencies, different people connect with different ideas. Different things make up each one of us. One idea is not necessarily better than another — it’s just that different ideas resonate with different people.</p>

<p>We each have to be true to what resonates inside of us. We each are here to be creators of life and love, to spread that to others. I am often envious of those blessed with great musical talent, to be able to share that with the world. But I know creation is inside of me. But part of that creation is taking from the world around me what resonates within my soul, taking what never loses energy and let it flow unto me forever and ever.</p>

<p>It is my hope to share some of those things from my world that resonate with me in later blog entries.</p>

<p>It was another one of those moments this morning.  You know it, right?  In my new car.  Leaning back, hand on the steering wheel.  Cruising down the freeway.  My favorite music is blasting, piped from my Android phone to the stereo system.</p>

<p>For a moment, it’s just me, the steering wheel, the road, and the music.  I’m not aware of anything else.  I wish I had better words to adequately express this state of flow and being.</p>

<p>But it doesn’t last forever.  I become aware of the pains, aches, and fevers in my body.  Sadness creeps back in, as I remember one of the last times I prominently had this profound experience, driving home from my ex-wife’s in the evening while we were dating.  The tears come as I think of those moments and subsequent moments with fondness, regret, and grief.</p>

<p>But, for a moment, it was just me, the loud music, the steering wheel, and the road.  I wasn’t “little Travis”.  I wasn’t sick.  I wasn’t divorced.  I wasn’t “less than”.</p>

<p>I treasure those moments.</p>

    <p>I went to lunch today at an Indian restaurant with my coworkers. When we went to pay, I ran into a very common problem for me.</p>

<p>I’m only 4’6″ (roughly 137 cm for my non-Imperial friends) tall.</p>

<p>The counter at the cash register was pretty much as tall as me. I could barely see over it. I certainly couldn’t reach to use it to sign my reciept when I paid. Like I said, a common problem for me. But wasn’t common was just a small thing — and I don’t even think I can fully describe how significant it was or what made it significant to me — that the owner of the restaurant did.</p>

<p>When I took my turn to step up to the counter to pay, she immediately apologized to me that I couldn’t reach or see things. After I handed her my card, she got one of those little folders for credit card receipts, stepped to the side of the counter, and handed it to me with my card and my receipt and a pen so I could sign the receipt. My coworkers had just signed their receipts on the top of the counter. But she made this kind little gesture to make it so I could sign things.</p>

<p>I don’t why it had such significance for me. She didn’t make a big deal out of things. But at the same time, she took a moment to help me out and did it in a kind manner. It’s these little things that make me comfortable and not fret about being different.</p>
