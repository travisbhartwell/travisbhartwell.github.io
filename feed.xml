    &lt;p&gt;A few days ago, version 1.9 of the Nix package manager
&lt;a href=&quot;https://nixos.org/releases/nix/nix-1.9/manual/#ssec-relnotes-1.9&quot;&gt;was released&lt;/a&gt;.
From the release notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;nix-shell can now be used as a #!-interpreter. This allows you to write scripts that dynamically fetch their own dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They followed with an example that used GHC’s &lt;code&gt;runhaskell&lt;/code&gt; to execute Haskell
code using libraries that had been specified in the shebang line.
Unfortunately, this specific example doesn’t work, as it isn’t sufficient
information for Haskell to find the Network.HTTP library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this notwithstanding, it is still an interesting change that I have found
useful.  To use it, start your scripts with two lines similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#! nix-shell -i python3 -p python3 python34Packages.pygobject3 libnotify gobjectIntrospection gdk_pixbuf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; parameter to nix-shell tells it which interpreter to use when executing
the script.  Often, it is from one of the dependencies, such as in the above
example.  The &lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt; parameter gives one or more dependencies to be used. After
the above lines follows the script (shamelessly borrowed from the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_notifications#Usage_in_programming&quot;&gt;ArchWiki&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#! nix-shell -i python3 -p python3 python34Packages.pygobject3 libnotify gobjectIntrospection gdk_pixbuf&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;gi.repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Notify&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Notify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello world&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Notify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Notification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello world&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;This is an example notification.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;dialog-information&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But its usefulness isn’t limited to just writing scripts interpreted by one of the
declared dependencies.  I needed to write a wrapper for some NodeJS scripts I
had installed in the node_modules directory of a project I am working on.  I
didn’t want Node installed globally, so I did this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/run/current-system/sw/bin/env nix-shell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!nix-shell -i bash -p nodejs&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;readonly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;BIN_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;$(cd -P &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;dirname &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;${BASH_SOURCE[0]}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; pwd)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;readonly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;CMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;$(basename ${BASH_SOURCE[0]/%-wrapper/})&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;${BIN_DIR}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;${CMD}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;$@&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply made a symlink for each program in my &lt;code&gt;node_modules/.bin&lt;/code&gt; directory to
this file, with the name &lt;code&gt;program-wrapper&lt;/code&gt;, for example, &lt;code&gt;tern-wrapper&lt;/code&gt; to wrap
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ternjs.net/&quot;&gt;tern&lt;/a&gt;.  Notice my script doesn’t directly call nodejs,
though the underlying script it calls does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more example.  I wrote the following script to render this document as I was
writing it to check the way it looked in HTML:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/run/current-system/sw/bin/env nix-shell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!nix-shell -i bash -p inotifyTools pandoc&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;readonly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;$*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$# &lt;/span&gt;-lt &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Usage:  ${0} MARKDOWN_FILE&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; 2&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;1
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; 2&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;1
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;MARKDOWN_FILE must exist before launching.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; 2&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;1
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exit &lt;/span&gt;1
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; ! -e &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;${FILE}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;${FILE} doesn&amp;#39;t yet exist, create it before launching!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; 2&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;1
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exit &lt;/span&gt;1
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Assume the extension is .md&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;readonly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;basename &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;${FILE}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;.md&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.html

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Press Control-C to quit watching for changes on ${FILE}.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    inotifywait -q -e modify &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;${FILE}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Updating HTML for ${FILE}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
        pandoc -s -f markdown -t html -o &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;${OUTPUT}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;${FILE}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last example, where I couldn’t use nix-shell in a shebang line.  I was
playing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/&quot;&gt;Hakyll&lt;/a&gt;.  After you use &lt;code&gt;haykll-init&lt;/code&gt;
to generate your project structure, all work is done by compiling your own code
(in this case, a &lt;code&gt;site.hs&lt;/code&gt; that has an accompanying cabal file.  Since something
similar to the example from the release notes didn’t work, I tried the
following, a variant of what I’ve used in &lt;code&gt;.nix&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#! nix-shell -i bash --pure  -p &amp;#39;pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (pkgs: with pkgs; [ hakyll cabal-install ])&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

cabal run &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nix-shell didn’t like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;nafai@shedemei:~/Documents/blog/hakyll/technically
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./site-wrapper 
error: syntax error, unexpected &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, at &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;string&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:1:66&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had to just make this one a regular shell script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/run/current-system/sw/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

nix-shell --pure &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
          -p &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (pkgs: with pkgs; [ hakyll cabal-install ])&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
          --run &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;cabal run $@&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, just in these last few days I’ve found interesting ways to use this new
capability.  I hope this gives some examples of how it may be used.  I welcome
any feedback from more experienced Nix users (or comments in general about my
scripting, I’m a little out of practice).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to move this content to a blog hosted on my own server once I figure
out a static blog generator to use and all of that associated nonsense.  Putting
this here for now, I will update with a pointer to the final location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find me at &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/travisbhartwell&quot;&gt;@travisbhartwell&lt;/a&gt; or as
&lt;code&gt;Nafai&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;#nixos&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://freenode.net&quot;&gt;freenode.net&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of my personal
code can now be found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://gitlab.com/u/travisbhartwell&quot;&gt;Gitlab&lt;/a&gt;,
including my shell scripts and my current configurations for
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nixos.org&quot;&gt;Nix OS&lt;/a&gt;, bash, X, &lt;a href=&quot;http://i3wm.org&quot;&gt;i3&lt;/a&gt;, and

    &lt;p&gt;I may be going blind&lt;br /&gt;
and the darkness encroaching from all sides.&lt;br /&gt;
But at least with clarity&lt;br /&gt;
now I see all directly in front of me&lt;br /&gt;
No longer the periphery is important&lt;br /&gt;
this I must finally accept&lt;br /&gt;
When looking straight forward&lt;br /&gt;
I see me, reflected right back.&lt;br /&gt;
In this mirror, I see the hurt and the pain and the exhaustion&lt;br /&gt;
all reflected so clearly in what is before me.&lt;br /&gt;
But also sometimes the clouds move&lt;br /&gt;
and the sun shines, revealing what is inside.&lt;br /&gt;
That glory, those heaven-sent photons&lt;br /&gt;
hit my heart with a whisper&lt;br /&gt;
I open my heart to finally hear&lt;br /&gt;
and I am lifted to that higher place&lt;br /&gt;
Elevated, I see that which is reflected back,&lt;br /&gt;
that right in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;
Different from before is what my dim eyes see&lt;br /&gt;
higher, noble, good, beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly, as if I’ve found just one last breath,&lt;br /&gt;
the exhaustion sets in.&lt;br /&gt;
My vision falls&lt;br /&gt;
but I hold it in my heart, a little spark.&lt;br /&gt;
Even when it feels I cannot rise to those lofty heights of grandeur&lt;br /&gt;
no longer one day I will see&lt;br /&gt;
So clearly, the light I see right in front of me&lt;br /&gt;
won’t be reflected back to me, but reality.  &lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;It often takes a long time to learn lessons and let them sink in. Sometimes we rebel against what we know that life is saying to us. But, sometimes, you get to a point where you can no longer ignore that which is front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is also due to a lifetime of things, but in recent months, my mind and heart have finally started opening up to the things I need to know and do. I never imagined, and still waver at times, that I would be able to reach the point I am or get on the path that I am. But, I realize all things will be provided. I just have to seek for those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this seeking is a lesson that I am learning. Most importantly is what we seek. When I desired peace and joy and strength, where was I looking? I was looking at where I had none. But by bringing my focus repeatedly back to what I truly want and the conditions that I need to have those things, then it will come about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In and of itself, this is a lesson for me; there is so much beyond my reach. I naturally think to get what I desire, I have to bring it to myself. But time and again, I have been taught what is most important is having the want first. And, then do what is in my power to bring about the circumstances needed for what I desire. If my desire is true and right, in those circumstances, I will see the blessings flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That action, no matter how small, is a critical part. As I have learned more of neuroscience, I realize our brains follow a simple reward-driven focus. The brain will naturally seek to have that release of neurochemicals that make it feel good. An oft used phrase is “What fires together, wires together.” If a certain action brings reward, the brain will form new neural connections to reinforce that. This is why habit — and in its extreme form, addiction — is so powerful. Your brain knows that certain things bring the desired reward, and it will bring all to bring that about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we as humans can recognize this and use it to craft those “right conditions” for whatever we want. What are the things that bring them about? I have once again embraced a long-lost habit of writing and journaling. I know, without a doubt, that it has been instrumental in the healing in all facets of my life that I have experienced in these last six months. When I forget what has worked in the past and let go, of course I don’t see the life I want. But, in retrospect, consistently the happiest and most authentic parts of my life have been when I have been writing. I remember that, and the other little things I know have helped. I no longer do them because I “have to”, but because just as sure as I need my medication to keep my body alive, I need writing and other activities to stay alive emotionally and spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to perhaps the key lesson I’ve learned. To remember. Spencer W. Kimball taught that “remember” was the most important word in the English language. Jesus Christ told his disciples that when sending them the Holy Ghost for comfort after he was gone, the Holy Ghost would bring all things to their remembrance. We cannot forget. What fires together, wires together. Neural pathways get formed. If we remember the blessings of our lives and what has worked in the past, what those things were associated with will work for you. It’s fundamental. Also, I have to remember what that I’ve been taught over and over that these things do not work if I don’t remember what has been taught to me as the order of love. I can’t do anything without first receiving the love of God and putting Him first in my life. It is only with his help that I can then show the love and self-care for myself, to have my own needs met. With my needs met, I can then show and share love with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still reminding myself of these things, every day and sometimes every hour. I’ve had to go back to first principles over and over in recent times to learn them. As I remember them, I also feel the nudge and the muse to not just keep it inside. I need to write these things. I will be exploring these ideas in greater detail in later blog posts in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was writing yet another blog post in my head this evening, I was going to use a source and ideas that many might think of as “new-agey” or dismiss as nonsense to explain the point I was making. I even found myself coming up with something to the effect of, “Even if you don’t believe this, look how it, as an even just a metaphor, fits with what I am trying to say.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was likely prompted a bit by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joeydevilla.com/2008/08/08/why-the-lucky-stiff-on-why-you-should-create/&quot;&gt;something I read&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the night, but I realized this was not an isolated instance for me. It’s something I’ve done several times before in my blog. And, even, all through out my life. I have apologized when using stories and ideas from my faith and its scriptures. I have apologized when the source of what I was sharing was so different from my church and that of many who might read it. I have even apologized when I used examples from calculus and physics to explain my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I do this? I know that it is something I have done and felt the need for my entire life. It started within my (extended in particular) family I was born into and has continued in most situations and circumstances all through out my life. But, yes, I have been indeed blessed with the love of and for so many people who are different from myself. But, somehow, this has resulted in a belief I’m working on overcoming that no one else is like me and those parts of me that are most different from whoever I am with or talking to need to be suppressed or hidden or apologized for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;§&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://iam.travishartwell.net/images/provoco-et-non-transverto/standardworks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LDS Standard Works&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have many wonderful friends that do not share my religious views and may even sharply disagree with them. I have many wonderful friends that have no religious belief at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my belief in God and my understanding of Him and how to “worship … according to the dictates of [my] own conscience” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.11?lang=eng#10&quot;&gt;Article of Faith 11&lt;/a&gt;), are simply that — my beliefs. When I talk of God or share quotes from the Book of Mormon or leaders of the church, I am not attacking anyone who might not believe in those things. I’m just explaining the world from my perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;§&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/provoco-et-non-transverto/Pema_Chodron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, of course, have many wonderful friends and family members that do share my religion and my church. Many of them seek for their spiritual understanding of the world solely from the teachings of the church, because that is what speaks to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I will often refer to teachings from a Buddhist teacher or some philosopher or even fiction. Likely, they may be uncomfortable with or question me in some way when I quote these things. But, again, that is me. I know that God  ” speaketh unto [us] according to [our] language, unto [our] understanding.” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.3?lang=eng#2&quot;&gt;2 Nephi 31:3&lt;/a&gt;). And, for me, my language and my understanding would be incomplete if it didn’t include truth and wisdom “out of the best books” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118?lang=eng#117&quot;&gt;Doctrine and Covenants 88:118&lt;/a&gt;) of all types. So, no need to apologize.  This is me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;§&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img src=&quot;/images/provoco-et-non-transverto/first-principles.png&quot; alt=&quot;First principles of differentiation&quot; /&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize a large number of my friends and family that read what I write either haven’t studied or don’t remember or understand mathematics and physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I see and describe the world through the lenses of math and science. They are the most basic ways to describe the world and the universe around us. And, just as I would do with the other examples mentioned, I consider my audience. But I still follow my mind and heart and use these things, as long as I am able to give enough context that my audience can understand the idea I am sharing. Again, no reason to apologize for using what I know and expresses things in my language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the impetus behind these thoughts belongs to a quote I read tonight. It was quoted in a technical blog entry entirely unrelated to what I’m writing about here. But it struck me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;when you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather
than ability. your tastes only narrow &amp;amp; exclude people. so create.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joeydevilla.com/2008/08/08/why-the-lucky-stiff-on-why-you-should-create/&quot;&gt;“why the lucky stiff” on Why You Should
Create&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem like above I am defending and defining myself by my tastes. But, in many ways, I see what I have done to this point as defining myself by my tastes more than ever. My tastes, preferences, and beliefs have defined how I act. And, in turn, I have allowed them and my feeling of “different” to hinder what I create. Whether it be in my relationships. Or the things that I write. Or just how I present myself to the world. My journals sometimes are vastly different from what anyone else sees on the outside. I don’t share most of those parts with even with my family. And, so, instead of writing or creating to teach and uplift and please the world, I keep those things hidden. I never create. I exclude certain groups or even the world from knowing what is in me. The view the world has of me is narrow. My shame over my tastes has defined me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name, though not chosen for this intention, has some deep and telling meaning. Being fascinated by words and language, I like to study word origins and meanings. I’ve discovered that Travis shares the same root as the word “traverse”, which is the Latin word “transversum”. The meaning of the Latin root is “laying across/from side to side; flanking/oblique; moving across/at right angle”. I once found Travis in a list of name meanings, and the one that stuck with me is “At the Crossroads”. The related word “traverse” has a meaning of “a route or way across or over”. It is these two meanings with each day become more and more significant to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/marksmallwoodcommunications/4311667717/&quot; title=&quot;Crossroads by MarkSmallwood, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/provoco-et-non-transverto/4311667717_f143ba91d7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Crossroads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crossroad is where two paths meet; you are not on either one but not really on both either. Before you lies a choice of which way to follow. In so many ways, I have felt at the crossroads in my life. Different from one group, but not quite another. Sitting there at the crossroads, I have views of the different paths. Those of my religion and those not. Those that grok mathematics and physics (and grok, too) and those that don’t. Those disabled and those who are not. Those who have had a healthy life and those seriously ill and looking at their mortality.   Those that use Emacs and those that use vim.  Those that use Ubuntu and those that use Fedora.  I could go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stand at the crossroads. A person would not apologize to someone they meet in the crossroads for having a different destination. They will freely share their destination is different. Why, then, shouldn’t I? Over and over in recent years it seems to be my role in life to be challenged by or to challenge others to look at things in another’s shoes and from a different perspective. Since I had thought about the Latin roots of my name, I had a friend who has studied Latin help me come up with a motto that you see as the tagline of my blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;provoco et non transverto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly, “I challenge and do not turn away.” It may not be entirely accurate in translation and grammar, but it’s the meaning I ascribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying not to make it more and more a challenge not of confrontation and fight. I have brought myself to that point many times in my life, in feeling the need to defend my tastes and views. I think part of the fight comes from the shame I have felt that has lead me to apologize or suppress. So, in fact, by being more willing to be open about what I hold dear and use those things freely to inspire and bring creation into my life, I think I will fight less. I will be able to share and learn the differences in the world with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my creations challenge others to think about their own views and understanding of the world and truth and beauty and I continue to create and not turn away from what is in me, I will be including all the world. So, I challenge you here, and I do not turn away. How do you let your tastes or perceived tastes of the world define what you create and the love you bring into the world? Can you let go of exclusion and narrowness? Can you see all the people in the world for their good and let them see yours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to do this better each day.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;Even though it had been a part of and possibility in my life at the beginning, I don’t think I was consciously aware of the concepts of pain and my own death until I was nearly 8. And the brief moments that taught me this I cannot ever forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in the last week of 1984 and I was still in the hospital recovering from my first surgery on my ankles. We didn’t have an entire room to ourselves. I remember the door to our room being open, letting in a little light and giving room for the nurses to peek in on their young patients. There were 4 or 6 beds in the room, each granted privacy only by some hanging curtains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those curtains were not enough to keep me from hearing what kept me awake that night. I remember lying awake in my bed. Whether I was woke by what comes next or was already awake, I don’t remember. But what I remember so clearly still sends chills up my spine and confusion to my soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want you to just shoot me, Mom! I want to die! It hurts too much! It isn’t working! Just get a gun and shoot me, Mom!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This came from a boy across the room and to the right of me. He was a few years older than me, perhaps 10. He was suffering from brain cancer. The treatments and chemotherapy had not brought the desired relief. Despite all efforts, they just had not worked. The doctors were asking his parents to consider one more round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those details may be fuzzy, but I do remember so clearly his words and the pain and anguish I heard in his voice. I remember also the heaviness of heart and confusion of soul that I felt as I lay there awake thinking about what I had heard. Twenty-seven years later, I still feel his words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that time, I have had my share of physical pain. And, perhaps I have not come so close to the face of death as my young friend, but at times I have felt his gaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s a difference between youth and experience. Or the degree of physical pain felt all at once. But my physical pain alone has not brought me to the agony of soul that this young boy felt, enough to plead for my death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in truth, I have found myself exclaiming and expressing the desire that he said so clearly. Wouldn’t it be better if my mortal journey ended? Wouldn’t the pain of body and soul finally be over? Could this not quickly come?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what brought me here, to express such pain? The story of Alma the Younger in the Book of Mormon is one of the clearest expressions of the emotional side of this pain that I know of. He and his friends had actively been working against the work of the church. As they were going about this, an angel of God appeared to them. When the angel commanded them to cease what they were doing, Alma woke up to the reality of the things that he had been doing. He finally saw how his actions had harmed others. He saw how his actions would keep him from God. He began to feel great pain and shame in his heart over these things. He looked forward to the future, and having to deal with the consequences of these actions. He wished to be “banished both body and soul” so he wouldn’t have to feel that pain now or the pain to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have dealt with the pains of surgery and disease, I also have walked a road in which I found myself made starkly aware of my own mistakes. I have seen the ways in which they have hurt other people. My weakness, in body and soul, has become so clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at times, the combined pain of body and soul I felt has been overwhelming. The dark robes of death seemed to loom over me at times. I, too, have laid in a hospital bed at night, pleading with a Parent to just let it end. I wanted to just be released from the pain that I felt. I have looked forward, just as Alma, to the road I will have to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, on that road, I only see more pain. Just as the young cancer patient was frustrated and tired, agonizing that his treatments were not working, I have seen the same. I can only see dialysis and another transplant in the eventual future on my road ahead. My physiology and the immunosuppressants I take make it nigh impossible to be without infection. And that infection continues to take its toll. And, with another transplant, it will likely take its toll there as well. It may not happen this month or this year, but I know I will one day be faced with this question, sooner than many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will another round of my treatment help? Or will it just prolong things? With the pain I continue to feel over my weakness and the consequences of my mistakes added upon, I wonder — do I continue? Do I have the strength in body and soul and mind to continue this road? Have I fulfilled my purpose here on earth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what happened to my fellow patient. Perhaps he soon passed and received the relief of body and soul he sought so desperately in the night. But the feeling and consequence of his words continue with me to this day, and connect me to my own questions, as I ask, “do I want to try again?” I’m just glad I was not faced with those questions back when I was nearly 8. The weight of just hearing another ask them was soul-searing enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://iam.travishartwell.net/2012/02/13/questions-asked-as-i-lay-in-a-hospital-bed/&quot;&gt;Questions Asked As I Lay In a Hospital Bed&lt;/a&gt; was originally published by Travis B.

    &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Time served on the earth doesn’t mean you grow in mind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;- Creed, Signs, Weathered&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to dedicate today to the four loves of my life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to the one whose love brought me life and held onto it&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to the one whose love brought me a second life&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to the one who, when I looked in her eyes, taught me love makes the man&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;finally, to my puppy love, whose love is pure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;∞&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five years ago, a spirit and a body came together, the creation of a new soul. But the body wasn’t quite ready for the spirit. In the order of the universe, though, this soul had to spring forth at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body, with its first gasp of air, with its first cry, began to seek and yearn only for what every other body desires — survival. But, instead of just breathing in and out and taking in the gifts the world has given, the soul needed more. From that very second, the soul knew it had to fight. It had to survive. And so, it began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where was this fight coming from? What was inside this child that was the spark to light this flame? Oh, how this boy wished he could just tell the world what he needed. But, alas, this new body could not. And so the fight began and it needed to get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, in reality, the fight was because something inside this body could get out. The boy’s bladder was blocked. He could not get the toxins and waste out of his body. And he could not tell anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It continued. The pain increased. The need for survival grew greater. And the fight within him grew as this did. The world around him seemed only interested on the surface, on what was on his outside. But the truth, the need, the real definition of that pure infant was written. And so, like a wild animal fighting for its very life (indeed, wasn’t that what was happening here?), his fight intensified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When what was accumulating inside of him was finally understood and was noticed, it was released. He was given relief. At least for now, the body could rest, it could heal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not the spirit. Unlike the body that was granted release, the boy did not let go of all that had gathered in the soul. In fact, the survival instinct made him fight and hold on even tighter. What could he not let go of? What did his entire being cling tightly to, as the only thing it had known?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fear. Fear that more would not notice what was inside. Fear that he might not live. And the fear fueled that fight. Even as he grew older and the memories of that time faded and consciousness grew, deep within the fight and fear were held close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battles that occur in the deep, silent chambers of the soul aren’t seen on the surface. At least, not initially. But, every now and again, the fear broke through and manifested at the surface. Pain. Confusion. Desperation. Sadness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little over thirty years passed from the birth of that new soul. Little did he know that his body and spirit had continued to fight. What had lingered in his body in his first few weeks of his life had taken its toll. And, the fight that his spirit held on to so tightly began to erupt. His body began to fail. And the spirit, still clinging so tightly to all it had known deep inside, fought for its life. But in so doing, it lost almost all that the soul had grown to hold dear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, here I stand, thirty-five years from that day. My body and soul, still with fight within. But it is taking its toll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m rusted and weathered, barely holdin’ together&lt;br /&gt;
I’m covered w/ skin that peels &amp;amp; it just won’t heal&lt;br /&gt;
…No, it just won’t heal, no, no, no  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun shines and I can’t avoid the light&lt;br /&gt;
I think I’m holdin’ on to life too tight…&lt;br /&gt;
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes I feel like giving up… yeah, I said,&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes I feel like giving up… ’cause I’m,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…It just won’t heal, no  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Cause one day it ends – One day we die&lt;br /&gt;
Believe what you will – That is your right&lt;br /&gt;
But I choose to win – I choose to fight…&lt;br /&gt;
To fight… ‘Cause I’m,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…Covered with skin that peels &amp;amp; it just won’t heal  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Creed, Weathered&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know so much what “winning” means any more.  Where does my story continue? The infections never leave my body. The very things that are keeping me alive — the immunosupression and the catheterization — are also the things that are keeping what is killing me inside my body. The infections will not leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what I try, my spirit and soul will not let go of the fighting, the pain, and the hurt of a lifetime. The fight is all my soul knows. But my head knows that it is no longer what I need, holding onto it will not bring me joy and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am, thirty-five years later. Who would have ever thought this is where I’d be today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the soul is so exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://iam.travishartwell.net/2012/02/10/midlife-not-so-much/&quot;&gt;Mid-Life, Not so Much&lt;/a&gt; was originally published by Travis B. Hartwell at &lt;a href=&quot;http://iam.travishartwell.net&quot;&gt;I am Travis&lt;/a&gt; on February 10, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
