  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>My friend <a href="http://cestdiego.github.io">Diego Berrocal</a> and I would like to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/travisbhartwell/nix-emacs/releases/tag/v0.0.1">nix-emacs v0.0.1</a>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4FZl_a7YQIA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe>

<p>nix-emacs adds support for searching and completing options in <a href="http://nixos.org">Nix OS</a> configuration files.  Nix OS is configured using the Nix expression language.  This includes configuration from your hostname to options for various services you may enable.  The <a href="https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/ch-options.html">online documentation</a> lists the abundant options available.  There is also a <a href="https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html">handy interface</a> for searching the options.</p>

<p>But, we found it less than ideal to have to constantly switch back and forth between the browser and our editor while editing our configurations.</p>

<p>Included is support for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <a href="https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/">helm</a> source for searching the options and viewing documentation</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://github.com/travisbhartwell/nix-emacs/raw/v0.0.1/img/helm-nixos-options.gif" alt="helm-nixos-options" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>A <a href="http://company-mode.github.io/">company</a> backend for completion of option names in nix-mode files.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://github.com/travisbhartwell/nix-emacs/raw/v0.0.1/img/company-nixos-options.gif" alt="company-nixos-options" /></p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/travisbhartwell/nix-emacs/blob/v0.0.1/README.org">README</a> for instructions on how to use nix-emacs.</p>

<p>We’ve submitted pull requests to get this included in <a href="http://melpa.org/#/">MELPA</a> so you can easily install it.  Also, we’ve submitted a pull request to <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/">Spacemacs</a>, the Emacs configuration we both use, to add a Nix layer, with everything configured out of the box.</p>

<p>This is just an initial release.  Hopefully more refinements to come.  Feel free to follow along on <a href="https://github.com/travisbhartwell/nix-emacs/">Github</a>.  Submit any issues you may have, submit pull requests, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>After an extended break in my career due to chronic illness, I am looking to return to part-time work.  Because of my location and inability to drive, this will have to be a remote position.</p>

<p>I am available starting tentatively the second week of September.  My goal is to work 15-20 hours a week.</p>

<p>I am experienced in both software development and system administration.  Professionally, I’ve primarily done work in Python and Java, and in packaging for and managing Debian and Ubuntu machines.  Lately, my interests have led me to use NixOS and to pursue learning Haskell and other functional programming languages.  Ideally, I’d love to work with the two of those.</p>

<p>I’ve been busy recently dipping my toes in various technologies and helping with open source projects, including Nix OS, Spacemacs, and the Lowbrow browser.  I’ve been doing remote pairing with friends.  I’ve been helping out on IRC and bug trackers for the projects that I use.</p>

<p>My primary skill is learning new technologies and learning the best ways to leverage tools.</p>

<p>Please reach out to me if you think I could help you out.  Check out my <a href="http://iam.travishartwell.net/resume/">resume</a> for further details on my experience and skills.</p>

    <p>I created a quick screencast the other day.  It was an introduction to <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/">Spacemacs</a>, a starter kit or configuration for Emacs, that is self-proclaimed as an “Emacs advanced Kit focused on Evil: The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it’s Emacs <em>and</em> Vim!”.  In this screencast, I cover installation, showing installation in an Ubuntu 15.04 virtual machine.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xFp9Jahs8Ng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe>

<p>All that is required is Gnus Emacs 24 and git.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A few days ago, version 1.9 of the Nix package manager
<a href="https://nixos.org/releases/nix/nix-1.9/manual/#ssec-relnotes-1.9">was released</a>.
From the release notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>nix-shell can now be used as a #!-interpreter. This allows you to write scripts that dynamically fetch their own dependencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They followed with an example that used GHC’s <code>runhaskell</code> to execute Haskell
code using libraries that had been specified in the shebang line.
Unfortunately, this specific example doesn’t work, as it isn’t sufficient
information for Haskell to find the Network.HTTP library.  But this notwithstanding,
it is still an interesting change that I have found useful.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>First, why would you use this?  Several reasons.  As quoted above, your scripts
can auto-fetch their own dependencies.  This makes sharing and deploying scripts
to other Nix-based systems easy.  No having to remember exactly everything that
is needed.  The script will fetch and install whatever it needs.  If the system
already has the package installed, Nix will just use that.</p>

<p>Second, I use this (as is one of my big motivations for Nix in general) to
isolate things.  I have the minimum set of packages installed to keep my system
running and support the applications I run regularly.  Then particularly for
project specific scripts – things not useful outside the context of the
project, or may have dependencies separate from what the system in general might
use – I like using <code>nix-shell</code> scripts.  I don’t have to install all of the
libraries (gems, npm packages, etc) needed and clutter up my system or <code>$HOME</code>.</p>

<h2 id="using-nix-shell-in-a-shebang-line">Using nix-shell in a Shebang Line</h2>

<p>To use it, start your scripts with two lines similar to this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell</span>
<span class="c">#! nix-shell -i python3 -p python3 python34Packages.pygobject3 libnotify gobjectIntrospection gdk_pixbuf</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This is a little different than some other shebang lines you might have seen
before.  First, why use <code>/usr/bin/env</code> instead of calling <code>nix-shell</code> directly?
As explained in the answers to this
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/29608/why-is-it-better-to-use-usr-bin-env-name-instead-of-path-to-name-as-my">Unix StackExchange question</a>,
this allows the script to be more portable.  On NixOS systems, you could
generally reference <code>/run/current-system/sw/bin/nix-shell</code> as the <code>nix-shell</code>
path.  In fact, in previous edits of this post I used that in some of my
examples.  But if you wanted to share this with a system that was using Nix on
top of another distribution or OS, that wouldn’t work.</p>

<p>Related, the second line is needed to get around a potential limitation
(depending on the system you are running on) in the way that interpreted scripts
are launched.  Quoting the <em>Interpreter scripts</em> paragraphs under the <em>NOTES</em>
section of the
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2) man page</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A maximum line length of 127 characters is allowed for the first line in an
interpreter scripts. </p>

  <p>The semantics of the optional-arg argument of an interpreter script vary
across implementations.  On Linux, the entire string following the interpreter
name is passed as a single argument to the interpreter, and this string can
include white space.  However, behavior differs on some other systems.  Some
systems use the first white space to terminate optional-arg. On  some
systems, an interpreter script can have multiple arguments, and white spaces
in optional-arg are used to delimit the arguments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the second line allows passing multiple arguments to <code>nix-shell</code>, allowing
for spaces in those arguments, and dealing with a potential line-length limit.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The <code>-i</code> parameter to <code>nix-shell</code> tells it which interpreter to use when executing
the script.  Often, it is from one of the dependencies, such as in the above
example.  The <code>-p</code> parameter gives one or more dependencies to be used. After
the above lines follows the script (shamelessly borrowed from the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_notifications#Usage_in_programming">ArchWiki</a>): </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="c">#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell</span>
<span class="c">#! nix-shell -i python3 -p python3 python34Packages.pygobject3 libnotify gobjectIntrospection gdk_pixbuf</span>

<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">gi.repository</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Notify</span>
<span class="n">Notify</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello world&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">Hello</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Notify</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Notification</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello world&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">&quot;This is an example notification.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">&quot;dialog-information&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">Hello</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">show</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></div>

<p>But its usefulness isn’t limited to just writing scripts interpreted by one of the
declared dependencies.  I needed to write a wrapper for some NodeJS scripts I
had installed in the node_modules directory of a project I am working on.  I
didn’t want Node installed globally, so I did this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell</span>
<span class="c">#! nix-shell -i bash -p nodejs</span>

<span class="nb">readonly </span><span class="nv">BIN_DIR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;$(cd -P &quot;</span><span class="k">$(</span>dirname <span class="s2">&quot;${BASH_SOURCE[0]}&quot;</span><span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">&quot; &amp;&amp; pwd)&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">readonly </span><span class="nv">CMD</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;$(basename ${BASH_SOURCE[0]/%-wrapper/})&quot;</span>

<span class="s2">&quot;${BIN_DIR}&quot;</span>/<span class="s2">&quot;${CMD}&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$@&quot;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I simply made a symlink for each program in my <code>node_modules/.bin</code> directory to
this file, with the name <code>program-wrapper</code>, for example, <code>tern-wrapper</code> to wrap
<a href="http://ternjs.net/">tern</a>.  Notice my script doesn’t directly call nodejs,
though the underlying script it calls does.</p>

<p>I wrote the following script to render this document as I was
writing it to check the way it looked in HTML:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell</span>
<span class="c">#! nix-shell -i bash -p inotifyTools pandoc</span>

    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;MARKDOWN_FILE must exist before launching.&quot;</span> 2&gt;<span class="p">&amp;</span>1
    <span class="nb">exit </span>1
<span class="k">fi</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> ! -e <span class="s2">&quot;${FILE}&quot;</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>

    <span class="nb">exit </span>1
<span class="k">fi</span>

<span class="c"># Assume the extension is .md</span>
<span class="nb">readonly </span><span class="nv">OUTPUT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>basename <span class="s2">&quot;${FILE}&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;.md&quot;</span><span class="k">)</span>.html

<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Press Control-C to quit watching for changes on ${FILE}.&quot;</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span>

<span class="k">done</span></code></pre></div>

<p>One last example, where I couldn’t use <code>nix-shell</code> in a shebang line.  I was
playing with <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>.  After you use <code>haykll-init</code>
to generate your project structure, all work is done by compiling your own code
(in this case, a <code>site.hs</code> that has an accompanying cabal file.  Since something
similar to the example from the release notes didn’t work, I tried the
following, a variant of what I’ve used in <code>.nix</code> files.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell</span>
<span class="c">#! nix-shell --pure -i bash -p &#39;pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (pkgs: with pkgs; [ hakyll cabal-install ])&#39;</span>

cabal run <span class="nv">$@</span></code></pre></div>

<p>But <code>nix-shell</code> didn’t like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">nafai@shedemei:~/Documents/blog/hakyll/technically
<span class="nv">$ </span>./site-wrapper 
error: syntax error, unexpected <span class="s1">&#39;)&#39;</span>, at <span class="o">(</span>string<span class="o">)</span>:1:66</code></pre></div>

<p>So I had to just make this one a regular shell script:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#! /usr/bin/env bash</span>

nix-shell --pure <span class="se">\</span>
          -p <span class="s2">&quot;pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (pkgs: with pkgs; [ hakyll cabal-install ])&quot;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
          --run <span class="s2">&quot;cabal run $@&quot;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Anyway, just in these last few days I’ve found interesting ways to use this new
capability.  I hope this gives some examples of how it may be used.  I plan on
writing more posts about other ways I have used this and other useful ways I
have used Nix tools.  I welcome any feedback from more experienced Nix users (or
comments in general about my scripting, I’m a little out of practice).</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<p>On June 22, 2015, I updated the post to expand the explanation of why this might
be used, why <code>/usr/bin/env</code> was used along with a second script line, and
cleaned up and made my examples more consistent.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, I forget I am not like the most of the world. Sometimes, I forget just how much our reality shapes our vision.</p>

<p>A few vignettes:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">¶</p>

<p>My sister Sharalyn recently reminded me of this story. We were young.   I was perhaps 7, she would have been 4.  By that time she was already taller than me.  Our Dad is a truck driver, and there were always trailers parked in our yard.  I would run underneath the front of the flat-bed trailers, instead of going around them, to get out to the mailbox by the road.  This one day, Sharalyn followed me.   Unfortunately, she was met with a big surprise.</p>

<p>Underneath the front of the trailer is a little metal rod called the kingpin.  It was what hooks the trailer up to the truck.  These are lubed with grease so they can turn.  It sticks down about six inches or so below the rest of the trailer.</p>

<p>I was short enough to go right underneath.  It didn’t occur to either me or my sister, at that age, that she could not.  She ended up getting grease all over in her hair and went inside really unhappy.  She recalls it as the first time it really clicked to her that she and I were different.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">¶</p>

<p>This morning, I was watching the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n-DOKBffuU">Mormon Messages video on Youtube</a>. I was still in bed myself, still hooked up to my dialysis machine. As I watched the mother in this video needing to get out of bed to go take care of her children, my natural thought was, “well, she needs to get unhooked first, before she can get up!” Of course, immediately, I realized that I was projecting my circumstance onto her. It was like having to all over again realize, hey, I’m different.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">¶</p>

<p>I remember a year or so ago watching a movie. Again, someone was just waking up and ready to get out of bed. They sat up and turned to the side of their bed. I remember thinking it was so odd that their feet touched the ground. My experience has always been no matter how high something is that I’m sitting on, my feet don’t reach the ground. In my mind, I took for granted the fact that not everyone is like this.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">¶</p>

<p>One last slightly different story. I was still at university, probably about 24-25. I was walking across campus by one of those buildings that was all glass. I glanced over as I was walking, and got a glimpse of my whole self. I remember doing a double-take. Was this really me? It was like I didn’t identify with the body I had lived my whole life in.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">§</p>

<p>I’ve always teetered the thin line between recognizing how myself or my life is different than most or thinking I’m just like everyone else (or they are just like me). As a child, I think I knew I wasn’t like my brother or sister. But, looking back, I don’t think it really clicked I was different. My experience this morning of projecting my normalcy of my dialysis procedure onto this women in the video shows how that continues. We each live in our reality, and it colors the way we see the world. A friend wrote on Facebook this morning how her life was so different from many of her friends, as they were writing about potty training or helping their children with homework, and she is single and her biggest worries are related to her responsibilities at work or news of the world.</p>

<p>Sometimes, whether it is a difference like being single instead of married and a parent, or dealing with chronic illness or not, or being a different race, or religion, or gender or whatever, you might constantly have to realize that difference in experience all over again. And, sometimes, that reminder carries with it a judgment (whether perceived or real) on the value of the difference.</p>

<p>I know that my experience is not like everyone else’s. Sometimes, perhaps there’s a twinge of sadness when I am reminded of that. And I know that sometimes others may experience something similar. A conversation may remind them of something they lack that they desire. Or how simply they are different. I know I have to be sensitive to others. And to remember, my views are through the lens of my experience, no matter how “normal” or “non-normal” it is.</p>
