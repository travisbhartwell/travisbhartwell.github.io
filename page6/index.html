    <blockquote>
  <p>I have on occasion cited the need for many reservoirs in our lives to
provide for our needs. I have said, “Some reservoirs are to store
water. Some are to store food, as we do in our family welfare program
and as Joseph did in the land of Egypt during the seven years of
plenty. There should also be reservoirs of knowledge to meet the
future needs; reservoirs of courage to overcome the floods of fear
that put uncertainty in our lives; reservoirs of physical strength to
help us meet the frequent burdens of work and illness; reservoirs of
goodness; reservoirs of stamina; reservoirs of faith.</p>

  <p>“Yes, especially reservoirs of faith, so that when the world presses
in upon us, we stand firm and strong; when the temptations of a
decaying [and, I should add, increasingly permissive and wicked]
world about us draw on our energies, sap our spiritual vitality, and
seek to pull us down, we need a storage of faith that can carry youth,
and later adults, over the dull, the difficult, the terrifying
moments; disappointments; disillusionments; and years of adversity,
want, confusion, and frustration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>via <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1977/10/the-foundations-of-righteousness?lang=eng">lds.org</a></p>

<p>There is much focus in the gospel about being self-reliant and prepared for the future. Unfortunately, I think the lesson that many of us focus on (myself included) in this is the temporal: food storage, staying out of debt, having emergency savings, and so forth. Obviously, without these basic needs, it is hard to focus on emotional and spiritual needs. But, in the intense self-examination that has taken place in my life over the past months, I have realized that not only have I neglected this basic commandment we all understand, but I have also neglected the principle underlying it President Kimball teaches.</p>

<p>From someone who has been through the most difficult trials life has brought me thus far (chronic illness, job losses, a great wake-up to my own weakness), it has become hard to not look back with the “Spirit of Truth” and see where I lack. There were times I needed great courage. There were times I needed great positivity. There were times I needed more love to share with others. And, most fully, there were times I needed greater faith. But, given the circumstances of my life, it felt more difficult to find these things in my life. I had not built a great reservoir of knowledge, of courage, of faith, of goodness, of all of the things I had needed during these times. When my body was ravaged with sickness, when side effects of the very medication and procedures that were keeping me alive made life difficult, when I slipped into depression because of job loss — in all of these things I needed to be added upon. But, I had not built that reservoir to draw upon in those times.</p>

<p>So, what can I do now? Certainly the trials of life are not over. On the days I have the strength, the time, the courage, and faith, how I can fill my reservoirs so I have that extra help in the future?</p>

<p>I admit to not knowing the answer; I wanted to just get this thought out there as it came to me today. I think the advice of King Benjamin (I always seem to go back to that sermon for some reason) applies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the
greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and
long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves
even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily,
and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come,</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/mosiah/4.11?lang=en#10">Mosiah 4:11</a></p>

<p>Remember, humble yourselves in prayer, and stand steadfast in faith. Give what you can every day.</p>

<p>I think, rather, I hope that Heavenly Father will let me know by his Spirit when I am doing my best, and nudge me when I am doing better, and that I can build up these reservoirs of strength to weather the trials that life may bring to me. Ultimately, I have hope that I can have the blessing that Alma, the sons of Mosiah, and their fellow missionaries had:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>they should suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up
in the joy of Christ.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Simon" title="Herbert Simon">Herbert Simon</a>
was perhaps the first person to articulate the concept of attention
economics when he wrote:</p>

  <p>“…in an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a
dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that
information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it
consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of
information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that
attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources
that might consume it” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy#CITEREFSimon1971">Simon 1971</a>,
p. 40-41).</p>

  <p>He noted that many designers of information systems incorrectly
represented their design problem as information scarcity rather than
attention scarcity, and as a result they built systems that excelled
at providing more and more information to people, when what was really
needed were systems that excelled at filtering out unimportant or
irrelevant information (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy#CITEREFSimon1996">Simon 1996</a>,
p. 143-144).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">en.wikipedia.org</a></p>

<p>I like especially the portion where Mr. Simon says “a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention”. This is a good description of many of my habits in using technology.</p>

<p>As a software developer (more precisely, a software tool developer), I’m particularly interested in his recommendation that “what was really needed were systems that excelled at filtering out unimportant or irrelevant information.” How can I better filter out information and yet take advantage of the wealth available? Good thoughts to ponder.</p>

  <p>While many people say multitasking makes them more productive,
research shows otherwise. Heavy multitaskers actually have more
trouble focusing and shutting out irrelevant information, scientists
say, and they experience more stress.</p>

  <p>And scientists are discovering that even after the multitasking ends,
fractured thinking and lack of focus persist. In other words, this is
also your brain <em>off</em> computers.</p>

  <p>“The technology is rewiring our brains,” said Nora Volkow, director of
the National Institute of Drug Abuse and one of the world’s leading
brain scientists. She and other researchers compare the lure of
digital stimulation less to that of drugs and alcohol than to food and
sex, which are essential but counterproductive in excess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>via <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/technology/07brain.html">nytimes.com</a></p>

<p>Though not directly a spiritual thing, I’m sharing this because I am starting to believe my interactions with technology (particularly over the last decade) have fundamentally rewired my brain and not necessarily in a good way.</p>

<p>In this moment of deep introspection and self-examination, I realize to become who I truly desire, I need to fundamentally alter how I use and interact with technology. Yes, I love technology. It is a fundamental part of my life and that will not change. But I think the place it plays in my life should change.</p>

    <p>I received the following quote in an email today, gives me hope for my road ahead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Road to Recovery</p>

  <p>“Each one who resolves to climb that steep road to recovery must gird up for the fight of a lifetime. But a lifetime is a prize well worth the price. This challenge uniquely involves the will, and the will can prevail. Healing doesn’t come after the first dose of any medicine. So the prescription must be followed firmly, bearing in mind that it often takes as long to recover as it did to become ill. But if made consistently and persistently, correct choices can cure.”</p>

  <p>– Russell M. Nelson M.D.</p>

  <p>The greatest achievement mankind can make in this world is to familiarize themselves with divine truth, so thoroughly, so perfectly, that the example or conduct of no creature living in the world can ever turn them away from the knowledge that they have obtained. “In the footsteps of the Master” … is the safest and surest course to pursue. … We can absorb the precepts, the doctrines and the divine word of the Master, without any fear that the exemplar will fail of carrying [them] out. …</p>

  <p>From my boyhood I have desired to learn the principles of the gospel in such a way and to such an extent that it would matter not to me who might fall from the truth, … who might fail to continue to follow the example of the Master, my foundation would be sure and certain in the truths that I have learned. …</p>

<p>via <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/richard-g-scott_acquiring-spiritual-knowledge/">speeches.byu.edu</a></p>

<p>I struggled to come up with the best quote from Elder Richard G. Scott’s speech “Acquiring Spiritual Knowledge” to capture the essence of why I am sharing this treasure.  Essentially, I am embarking on my own spiritual journey, a renewal, and an attempt to gain understanding of my place and path in this world.</p>

<p>I hope to share talks, speeches, articles, scripture passages, and book summaries containing ideas that are influencing me.  I hope that I can get ideas and comments so that my understanding of the basic, core principles of life may increase and perhaps I too can help someone else in this journey.</p>
